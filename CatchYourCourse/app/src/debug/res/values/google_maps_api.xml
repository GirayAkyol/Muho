    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=09:AD:C0:36:FA:A3:EE:0E:B3:40:24:02:84:3B:C1:D5:32:6C:F5:2F%3Bio.github.cs102g1j.nav

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    io.github.cs102g1j.nav

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    09:AD:C0:36:FA:A3:EE:0E:B3:40:24:02:84:3B:C1:D5:32:6C:F5:2F

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.

    <!-- Muhammed: I've generated and added a key for the API. Since it is presumably related
     with package name, please do not change. During adding other features check package name -->
