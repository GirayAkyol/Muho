## g1J ~~ Catch Your Course ~~

## Project Description
Our project’s aim is to make the students eager to go to their courses all the time. Also, we want to make the school life of every student enjoyable... Simply, our project tries to motivate the students to attend their lectures on time by making them play a fun game. This game includes catching the professors of the students’ lesson and earning points while doing so. When the student catches an amount of items, which will be determined by the app, the student is rewarded and has a chance to be on the leaderboards of the app. Furthermore, our app will have another feature. This feature includes finding the classrooms inside a labyrinthine building, for example the G building. Especially freshmen students confuse the places of the classrooms and they can be late to their lectures. Using our app, a student can find the classroom of his lecture and have the intention to attend a lecture on time to play the game and catch the professor of that lesson, knowing he will be rewarded if he catches as many items as he can.\
