On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project.
This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 20.04.2020 - 27.04.2020 ~
I kind of learned the basics of android studio (creating projects, adding buttons etc.).
I am trying to learn virtual machine so that I can test my application.
I have been still trying to learn some configuration settings and which softwares are preffered to set up so that I can run the applications withut any problem.

### ~ 27.04.2020 - 04.05.2020 ~
I learned how to use action listeners in android studio and created a game depending a character's weight, action time etc.
I kind of learned using images taking input from the user.
After now my plan is learning navigation specifically and combining my basic knowlede with this so that it can be used to take location of person and pokemon in our application.

### ~ 04.05.2020 - 11.05.2020 ~
1- I learned how to use and apply google app in my application.
2 - I created MapsActivity activity class which has properties to store the data of the building that lessons are given and it also properties such as isInEEBuilding,
which checks whether the user is near to his lesson's building less than 15 meters and whether it is correct time, i.e., from 10 minutes ago of the lesson's start time until the start time of the lesson.
3 - I created properties like isInEEBuilding in such a way that it updates its boolean value whenever location is changed.
4- I added distance method to the class to measure the difference between two points on earth where the points are specified according to their latitude and longitude.
5 - I added MyDate class so that I restore the right time to show the pokemons for specific buildings.

### ~ 11.05.2020 - 18.05.2020 ~
I am trying to figure out how to transmit infromation from MapsActivity to AR class.
Added isTimeToAppear property so that my team mates can use it to decide whether it is time to appear pokemon or not.
