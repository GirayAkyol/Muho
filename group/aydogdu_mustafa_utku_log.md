On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~  Week 12: April 20 to April 26  ~
This week I started learning Android Studio basics such as the features( Texts,buttons,layouts,virtual machines, etc.) and syntax ( differences on known interfaces,methods,etc.) of the of the IDE.

Created a basic Pokemon Android app which is based on the ActionListener( now OnClickListener) logic. More progress on the way...




### ~  Week 13: April 27 to May 4 ~
Created an Memory game based on remembering the paired cards.
Created a TicTacToe game.
Started working on Navigation ( taking the location of the user, showing the user's location etc.). However, it seems quite unrelated to what we have learned in Java for the year and therefore encountering problems understanding the logic of the codes.

###~  Week 14: April 4 to May 11 ~
Worked on the GPS part of our program. Completed the taking the user location and making the program work in background parts with Mustafa ; however,we still need to integrate these two parts. 

###~  Week 15: April 11 to May 18
Created an interface that users can enter their schedules( classes,building,dates) and provided a way to keep these information in a way similar to " a database" (GSON AND JSON ARE USED AT THİS PART). Therefore, know we are able to flow data between classes such as MapsActivity,AR and helper classes.
