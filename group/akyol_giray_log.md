On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ Week 12: April 20 to April 26 ~
(Late but)
* Started looking at Android API.
* Started looking IntelliJ templates for code. 

### ~ Week 13: April 27 to May 3 ~
* Finished and merged code templates.
* Looked at ARCore even more (it is way way way harder than it looks).

### ~ Week 14: May 4 to May 10 ~
* Found out that ARCore is too complex to use raw, so researched abstractions for it (KudanAR, Sceneform).  

### ~ Week 15: May 11 to May 17 ~
* Looked at sample apps for Sceneform and made a prototype based on those and committed it.

blah, blah, blah...
