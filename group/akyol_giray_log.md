On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ Week 12: April 20 to April 26 ~
(Late but)
* Started looking at Android API.
* Started looking IntelliJ templates for code. 

### ~ Week 13: April 27 to May 3 ~
* Finished and merged code templates.
* Looked at ARCore even more (it is way way way harder than it looks).

### ~ date ~
blah, blah, blah...
