On this page I will keep a weekly record of
what I have done for the CS102 group project.
This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository,
in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ Week 12: April 20 to April 26 ~
* I learned basics of Android Studio,
value assignments as well as creating text/button objects for android,
xml - java relations, generating apk ( either signed or unsigned)...
* Generated inital files from Android Studio templates.
* Created a guide for repository synchronization
through Github Desktop and  Android Studio.
* Made an application (to apply) for Play Console ( Play Store developer portal).

### ~ Week 14: May 4 to May 10 ~
* This week I helped Mustafa to implement MapsActivity class
and designed Building and MyClasses (MyActivities could be a better name) class'es
and also redesigned MyDate class. But someone else will write the java code.
* I searched for AR frameworks:  
kudanAR: failed due to licence key problem
ARCore: better and can be implemented, of course I have still a long way to go
* Looked for Google sign-in implementation,
but I couldn't get a key to implement it.
Because I couldn't provide a verified web address.
* Designed Home fragment.
Learned how to add and modify the item to toolbar
* Prepared/ing UML diagram(s) for detailed design report via https://creately.com/
