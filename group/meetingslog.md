### Meeting ~ (2020.05.03, around an and half hour zoom teleconference)
****
**Present:** Muhammed Can Küçükaslan, Mustafa Yasir Altunhan, Giray Akyol, Mustafa Utku Aydoğdu, Melis Atun.
   _**Absent:**_  Deniz Hayri Özay.

**Discussion:** 
We reviewed discontinuance of the project due to complexity of android studio and AR SDKs, we faced with the huge difference between these technologies and what we ought to use and learn in the course. Utku mentioned some useful video lectures that helps to use Android Studio and showed sample apps he created -which are unfortunately (presumably) does not count in his effort because these apps are not parts of project, however, his experience will helps us in our project. (ps. to prof: I, Muhammed, personally want you to take my colleagues efforts into account while grading besides "actual work" in the project)-, Mustafa and Melis talked their work on the Android Studio. Muhammed had slept and has not yet completed much this week 13, but promised to do so this week (ps. from the future: and doing)! We decided we need to do two main things: 1) location-navigation which is assigned to Mustafa & Utku, and 2) AR which is assigned to Giray, Muhammed, and Melis.

### Meeting ~ (2020.05.06, ~15 minutes of Teleconference and much longer time through texting)
****
**Present:** Muhammed Can Küçükaslan, Giray Akyol
**Discussion:** 
Giray explained his concerns about the complexity of Google's ARCore and suggested to examine other AR frameworks. Both Muhammed and Giray are searching for AR framework and how to implement it in the our app.  
Our app was planned to generate "pokemon items" according to location/class but considering current situation (ps. for the future: Universities are closed and moved to online lectures due to Covid-19 precautions in 2020, in Turkey) we can't test or do this. Therefore, we agreed that an alternative test may be randomly generating items for now.
